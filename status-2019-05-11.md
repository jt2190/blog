On Tuesday I signed up for [Thinkster.io](https://thinkster.io) with the discount I'd gotten at [ng-conf 2019](https://www.ng-conf.org/). My near-term goal is to complete [the courses on Angular](https://thinkster.io/topics/angular2) so that I can have some "proof of knowledge" to show my employer. I'm already familiar with Angular having completed the Tour of Heros some time ago, and more recently I've been trying to get "hands-on"/"real world" by building an app of my own. (See [jt2190/swag]). I'm forcing myself to complete all of the basic material starting with [Getting started with typescript](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-typescript). It's awfully tempting to skip the intro material that I'm already familiar with, but I think it's a good discipline to go through it anyway, because sometimes I pick up a small detail that I might otherwise have missed.
